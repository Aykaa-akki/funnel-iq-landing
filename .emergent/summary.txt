<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user wants to build a premium, high-conversion, multi-page landing site for a service called Funnel-IQ. The service is an expert funnel audit priced at ₹5,999. The project requires a home page, a checkout page with live Razorpay payment integration, and a thank-you page. The user also requested the creation of legal pages (Privacy, Terms, Refund), integration of Google Tag Manager, and assistance with deploying the full-stack application to a custom domain () using free hosting services. Multiple rounds of iterative feedback on UI, content, and functionality were provided. Finally, the user asked for a high-level marketing plan.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Home Page:** Professional design with a dark theme and neon green accents, showcasing the PAS framework, trust badges (1044+ audits, 11-40% ROI), features, testimonials, FAQs, and pricing.
2.  **Checkout Page:** A form to collect user details and a live Razorpay payment integration.
3.  **Thank You Page:** A confirmation page post-payment, including a button to a Tally form for collecting additional details.
4.  **Legal Pages:** Separate pages for Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Refund Policy.
5.  **Deployment:** The full-stack application must be deployed live on the user's domain  under the path .
6.  **Integrations:** Google Tag Manager and Razorpay (Live).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete, live, and functional full-stack application.
-   **Frontend:** A multi-page React application (Home, Checkout, Thank You, and legal pages) styled with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components, following a neon-dark-kit design playbook. It is deployed on Vercel and accessible via the user's custom domain.
-   **Backend:** A FastAPI application that handles Razorpay payment order creation and verification. It's deployed on Railway and connected to a MongoDB database.
-   **Integrations:** Razorpay is fully integrated with live keys. Google Tag Manager is included in the frontend. The application is connected to the user's GitHub repository for CI/CD.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent's last action was responding to the user's request for a marketing plan by providing a high-level framework. The user then indicated they had more feedback for the live site to make it fully live. The agent is now awaiting this feedback. The last technical task was the successful deployment of the full-stack application and confirmation of the live Razorpay payment flow.
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- Agent Testing Done: Y

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Awaiting final user feedback for the live website. (P0)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - Attempted fixes: N/A. The agent is waiting for the user to provide the feedback.
    - Next debug checklist:
        1.  Receive the list of changes from the user.
        2.  Analyze the feedback and create a clear implementation plan.
        3.  Execute the changes in the codebase (frontend and/or backend).
        4.  Commit and push the changes to the  branch on GitHub to trigger auto-deployment on Vercel and Railway.
        5.  Verify the changes on the live site.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To implement the user's final requested changes and finalize the landing page for their marketing campaigns.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
    - Blocked on other issue: None. Blocked on user input.

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
-   **Task 1 (P0):** Implement the user's final feedback on the live site (). This is the immediate next step upon receiving the feedback.

Future Tasks:
-   **Task 1 (P1):** Implement automated payment tracking. The user asked if payments could be tracked in a Google Sheet. The current solution requires checking the Razorpay dashboard or the MongoDB database. A future task would be to create a backend webhook to listen for successful payments and populate a Google Sheet automatically.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Frontend Development:**
    - Created a multi-page React application (Home, Checkout, Thank You, Privacy, Terms, Refund) from scratch.
    - Implemented a neon-dark-kit design system with a dark theme and neon green accents.
    - Added all required sections: hero, trust badges, features, sample findings, testimonials, pricing, offer stack, FAQ, and footer.
    - Integrated Google Tag Manager into .
    - Made the site fully mobile-responsive.
- **Backend Development:**
    - Created a FastAPI backend with endpoints for Razorpay integration.
    - : To create a payment order.
    - : To verify payment signature.
- **Deployment & CI/CD:**
    - Guided the user to create a GitHub repository.
    - Pushed the entire  monorepo to the user's GitHub.
    - Deployed the frontend to Vercel and connected it to the user's GoDaddy domain ().
    - Deployed the backend to Railway.
    - Configured CI/CD for both services, where a  to the  branch automatically triggers new deployments.
- **Integration:**
    - Successfully integrated the live Vercel frontend with the live Railway backend.
    - Integrated Razorpay with live user-provided keys, making the payment flow fully functional.
- **Debugging:**
    - Resolved multiple Vercel build failures related to a missing  file and incorrect build configurations.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Automated Payment Tracking:**
    - Debug checklist: The user asked for a way to track payments in a Google Sheet. The agent suggested using the Razorpay dashboard and the database. The task to automate this (e.g., via a webhook to Google Sheets) was not implemented.
    - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? To provide the user with a convenient, real-time, and centralized way to track customer payments without needing to access the database or Razorpay dashboard.
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Backend
    - Is recurring issue? N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A
